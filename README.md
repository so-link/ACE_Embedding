# ACE: Ant Colony Based Multi-Level Network Embedding for Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning

The datasets and the source code of this paper are integrated in [NetworkEmbedding_Torch](https://github.com/so-link/NetworkEmbedding_Torch.git), in which HARP and some classical network embedding algorithms like DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec are also included.

The docs of [NetworkEmbedding_Torch](https://github.com/so-link/NetworkEmbedding_Torch.git) are under construction...
